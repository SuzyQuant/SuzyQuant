* Three steps:
  * Observation
    * What's the problem(s)? Example,
        * skills of labor
        * tools used were crude
        * work shifts were randomly assigned

        * No business process or work flow to follow
        * Managers don't know what workers are working, couldn't give feedback then

  * Analysis
