What taxonomy was established?

<b>Atoms, molecules, and organisms imply a hierarchy</b> that anyone with a basic knowledge of chemistry can hopefully wrap their head around.

Atomic design applies to all user interfaces, not just web-based ones.

Let me be clear about this: <b>atomic design has nothing to do with web-specific subjects like CSS or JavaScript architecture</b>. 

But atomic design is not rigid dogma. Ultimately, whatever taxonomy you choose to work with should help you and your organization communicate more effectively in order to craft an amazing UI design system.

This chapter introduced the atomic design methodology and demonstrated how atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages all work together to craft thoughtful, deliberate interface design systems. Atomic design allows us to see our UIs broken down to their atomic elements, and also allows us to simultaneously step through how those elements join together to form our final UIs. We learned about the tight bond between content and design, and how atomic design allows us to craft design systems that are tailored to the content that lives inside them. And finally we learned how the language of atomic design gives us a helpful shorthand for discussing modularity with our colleagues, and provides a much needed sense of hierarchy in our design systems.

Atomic design is a helpful design and development methodology, but essentially itâ€™s merely a mental model for constructing a UI.
