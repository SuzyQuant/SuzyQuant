S.M.A.R.T. S.T.A.R. is a part of doing requirement engineering. S is specific, M is measurable, A is achievable, R is realistic, and T is timely. For the S.T.A.R., S is space where you define the who, what, where, when of the project. It shows the dimensions of where your project sits in. T is Track where you discuss the past, present, and future space of the project. A is assist where it shows how you will make an impact or actions today to change the track and make an impact. R is reach where it points out what results you are expecting and how far your impact shifts the energy of the project.

Create a S.M.A.R.T. S.T.A.R. for the goal of completing the D.R.O.I.D. Narrative where we define D as design, R as research, O as optimize, I as integrate, and D as deliver in achieving dreams or company goals. Then incorporate it into 4 levels of companies where each company has a different level of applying the DROID program for example Company 1 is focused on literacy and training of the DROID, Company 2 is focused on using a quick DROID for startups projects, Company 3 is focused on the use of DROID for projects in a global scale, and Company 4 is focused on a very comprehensive use of DROIDS in a universal scale.

D - Deliver: Deliver the DROID to startup companies worldwide. Monitor feedback and usage data to continually improve the DROID's performance and usability.

Company 3: DROIDs for Global Scale Projects
D - Design: Design a scalable, modular interface that can be customized to meet the needs of different global projects. The design should be flexible enough to accommodate a variety of project types and sizes, from small-scale initiatives to large, complex undertakings.
R - Research: Conduct extensive research into the needs and preferences of global project teams, and identify areas where the DROID can add value. Consult with experts in the field of project management to ensure the DROID aligns with current best practices.
O - Optimize: Optimize the DROID's performance for global projects, with a focus on collaboration, communication, and coordination. Use feedback from users to identify areas for improvement and refine the DROID's functionality.
I - Integrate: Integrate the DROID into project management platforms, collaboration tools, and other systems commonly used in global project settings. Work with project managers to develop workflows and processes that incorporate the DROID's capabilities.
D - Deliver: Deliver the DROID to global project teams and organizations worldwide. Monitor feedback and usage data to continually improve the DROID's performance and usability.

Company 4: Comprehensive Use of DROIDs in a Universal Scale
D - Design: Design a comprehensive, modular interface that can be adapted to meet the needs of a wide range of industries and applications. The design should be flexible enough to accommodate everything from small-scale projects to large-scale, universal initiatives.
R - Research: Conduct extensive research into the potential applications of DROIDs in various industries and sectors, and identify areas where the DROID can have the greatest impact. Consult with experts in each field to ensure the DROID aligns with current industry trends and practices.
O - Optimize: Optimize the DROID's performance for universal use, with a focus on versatility, scalability, and adaptability. Use feedback from users to identify areas for improvement and refine the DROID's functionality.
I - Integrate: Integrate the DROID into a wide range of systems and applications, including enterprise resource planning software, data analytics platforms, and other key technologies. Work with industry leaders to develop custom solutions and workflows that incorporate the DROID's capabilities.
D - Deliver: Deliver the DROID to organizations worldwide, and provide ongoing support and maintenance to ensure optimal performance. Continually monitor feedback and usage data to improve the DROID's functionality and enhance its impact.

In summary, for all four companies, the S.M.A.R.T. S.T.A.R. framework has been applied to ensure that the DROID project is specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. The framework has helped to define the goals, objectives, and strategies for each company, ensuring that the DROID is aligned with the needs and preferences of its target audience. By using the S.M.A.R.T. S.T.A.R. framework, each company can track progress and evaluate success, ensuring that the DROID project delivers the desired outcomes and impact.
