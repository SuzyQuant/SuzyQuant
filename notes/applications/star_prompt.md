S.M.A.R.T. S.T.A.R. is a part of doing requirement engineering. S is specific, M is measurable, A is achievable, R is realistic, and T is timely. For the S.T.A.R., S is space where you define the who, what, where, when of the project. It shows the dimensions of where your project sits in. T is Track where you discuss the past, present, and future space of the project. A is assist where it shows how you will make an impact or actions today to change the track and make an impact. R is reach where it points out what results you are expecting and how far your impact shifts the energy of the project.

Create a S.M.A.R.T. S.T.A.R. for the goal of completing the D.R.O.I.D. Narrative where we define D as design, R as research, O as optimize, I as integrate, and D as deliver in achieving dreams or company goals. Then incorporate it into 4 levels of companies where each company has a different level of applying the DROID program for example Company 1 is focused on literacy and training of the DROID, Company 2 is focused on using a quick DROID for startups projects, Company 3 is focused on the use of DROID for projects in a global scale, and Company 4 is focused on a very comprehensive use of DROIDS in a universal scale.

Creating S.T.A.R. is part of doing requirement engineering. S is Space, it's where you define the who, what, where, when of the project. It shows the dimensions of where your project sits in. T is Track,  where you discuss the past, present, and future space of the project. A is Assist, where it shows how you will make an impact or actions today to change the track and make an impact. R is Reach, where it points out what results you are expecting and how far your impact shifts the energy of the project. We make sure our S.T.A.R. are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and is timely.

D.R.O.I.D. Program is where we define D as design, R as research, O as optimize, I as integrate, and D as deliver in achieving dreams or company goals. Create a S.T.A.R.  for completing the D.R.O.I.D. Narrative across four different levels of companies for example Company 1 is focused on literacy and training of the DROID, Company 2 is focused on using a quick DROID for startups projects, Company 3 is focused on the use of DROID for projects in a global scale, and Company 4 is focused on a very comprehensive use of DROIDS in a universal scale.
