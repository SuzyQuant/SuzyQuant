### Overview
There is a need of how to look after employee efficiency that is by monitoring their work hours. The app built need some minor tweaks in order to run smoothly. I've learned that there is the terminal, cmd, and powershell to run scripts and all is owned by Microsoft and inside Azure. Also you can use Power Automate but better to use Logic Apps for programmer. I'm continuously learning some batch file programming, with logic app integration using API, ASCII online to convert your desired texts to a program, and bat to exe converter.

### Values
The values I've learned from my direct supervisor, through observation are
* **tenacity** - when there's a problem, don't give up and be patient
* **research** - find solution and be tenacious
* **reading** - read slowly, and if you don't understand, then read again.
* **multiple sourcing** - don't limit to just texts, but also consider videos or maybe chatGPT
* **run multiple times** - after changing something
* **comment** - so you know what the line of code does
* **able to multi-task** is not recommended for juniors but if you become better then do it
* **stick to one platform** like Microsoft for all (GitHub, LogicApps, VS Studio)
* **trial and error** - LOTS!
* you can **take breaks**!
* **patience** - it takes time to build something beautiful, so be patient.
