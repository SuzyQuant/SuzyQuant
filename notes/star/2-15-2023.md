Space: The present state of the EB-2 NIW Visa Checklist is almost complete. This visa helps individuals with advanced degrees to show ways how their work benefits the United States. The checklist can also be used by anyone for their own application.  

Track: The completion of the checklist would entail 2-3 months if an hour is devoted to finishing at least 1 of the items. They need not be followed from top to bottom but do the easiest items first. Creating folders during the data gathering would help in organizing the documents. Having team members for example, or if one has hired a consultant, checking up on their progress would be beneficial too. Having a roadmap to accomplish the checklist would also help in achieving success within a 2-3 month period or earlier than that. 

Assist: I am one of the applicants for an EB-2 NIW Visa. Today, I'll be forking the markdown file and I'll continue in the compilation of immigration documents. Since, most of these documents are almost done, I'll be progressing towards the Letters of Interest area in the checklist.  

Reach: The current achievements from the checklist are that most immigration files are at hand. There are only two recommendation letters at hand, therefore, getting letters of recommendation from previous projects needs done. I can move on to writing the 1st prong narrative next.
