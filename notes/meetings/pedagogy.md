Goal is to create a strong pedagogical method that the AST Program will sit inside of.

This approach needs:

* Curriculum Overview
* Curriculum Design
* Grading System
* Performance Metric System
* Syllabus Design
* Student Guide
* Teacher Guide&nbsp;

Will rely on GitHub for performance metrics

We also will use a proprietary "Reels" system for watching content & getting credit for showing up to class by watching Reels.&nbsp;

Then, we will have SMILE Method with Timmsi Internships as the last piece of the puzzle

So, multiple main areas will be:

* DreamWave
  * Create your Ikigai
  * Learn the Unalome
* Curiosity Camp
  * 6-Month free bootcamp
  * Learn our pedagogical approach
  * Ignite your curiosity
* FocusPass
  * Focus App
    * Track your progress
  * Focus Hive
    * Work with Teams
* Jivva & Jaivai Magazines
  * Reels System
  * Similar to FlipGrid.com
  * Similar to TikTok, but tracked for education purposes & content around education
* Xpress Lab&nbsp;
  * Git Commits
  * Maybe purchase XpressLab.org for this??
* Timmsi (SMILE Spaces Partnerships)

Let's look at this overall Pedagogical Approach and see if we are missing anything inside it.

Using OpenAI:

Open AI Answer:

1. "Future-Ready Learning"
2. "Innovative Career Training"
3. "High-Tech and Career-Focused Expeditionary Learning"

Pedagogical Method: "Future-Ready Learning"

"Future-Ready Learning" is a blended approach to education that focuses on preparing students for careers 20-30 years in the future. It combines elements of the Flipped Classroom, High-Tech Approach, High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning, Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing, Personalized Learning, High Tech and Low Tech Game-Based Learning and Universal Design for Learning. The method places a strong emphasis on developing the skills and knowledge that will be in high demand in the future of work such as problem-solving, critical thinking, technology literacy, and creativity.

Students learn through real-world projects, simulations, and hands-on experiences that are designed to mirror the work environment. The curriculum is personalized to the interests and needs of the students and their future career aspirations. Teachers act as facilitators and guides, providing support and resources as students work on projects and explore their passions. Logotherapy and Student-centered approach are also integrated to help students to develop their personal and professional skills that are required to be successful in their future careers. This approach focuses on providing students with opportunities to connect with industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators to gain insight into the future of work and the skills required to succeed in it.

**TASK:** Convert Future-Ready Learning into 3 pages by writing out or expanding on the line "Flipped Classroom, High-Tech Approach, High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning, Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing, Personalized Learning, High Tech and Low Tech Game-Based Learning and Universal Design for Learning."

Introduction

In today's rapidly changing world, the traditional educational model is no longer sufficient to prepare students for the future of work. The future requires individuals who are not only knowledgeable but also creative, problem solvers, tech-savvy, and have a growth mindset. The Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method is designed to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the future of work. This comprehensive and holistic approach to education combines elements of the Flipped Classroom, High-Tech Approach, High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning, Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing, Personalized Learning, High Tech and Low Tech Game-Based Learning, and Universal Design for Learning.

Flipped Classroom and High-Tech Approach

The Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method starts with the flipped classroom approach, where students watch video lectures and complete readings and quizzes outside of class, while class time is spent on active learning activities such as discussions, group work, and problem-solving. This allows students to learn at their own pace, providing teachers with more time to work with students one-on-one or in small groups. Additionally, high-tech approach emphasizes the use of technology in the classroom to enhance learning. This can include the use of digital resources such as videos, simulations, and interactive whiteboards, as well as the integration of mobile devices and other technology tools.

High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning and Personalized Learning

The Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method also includes High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning. This approach focuses on students' active engagement in the learning process, where students are encouraged to ask questions and explore the subject matter on their own. By using technology, students can access a wealth of information and resources, which allows them to take ownership of their learning. This is paired with personalized learning, where instruction is tailored to the unique needs and interests of each student. This can include the use of technology tools to provide individualized instruction, as well as the use of formative assessments to track student progress and adjust instruction accordingly.

Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing

Real-world, hands-on learning experiences are a crucial component of the Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method. This includes internships, trips, and job shadowing opportunities that allow students to apply what they have learned in the classroom to real-world situations. These experiences provide students with a chance to connect with industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators, gaining insight into the future of work and the skills required to succeed in it.

High Tech and Low Tech Game-Based Learning and Universal Design for Learning

To further engage students and make learning more interactive, the Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method incorporates game-based learning. This approach uses games and simulations to teach and reinforce key concepts and skills. The Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method also includes Universal Design for Learning (UDL) which is an approach that provides all students with equal opportunities to learn by proactively addressing potential barriers and creating flexible learning environments.

Conclusion

The Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method is a comprehensive and holistic approach to education that combines elements of the Flipped Classroom, High-Tech Approach, High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning, Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing, Personalized Learning, High Tech and Low Tech Game-Based Learning, and Universal Design for Learning. This method is designed to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the future of work. By adopting the Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method, our University is preparing students for the future, setting them up<br /><br />

In conclusion, the Future-Ready Learning pedagogical method is a comprehensive and holistic approach to education that is designed to prepare students for the future of work. By combining elements of the Flipped Classroom, High-Tech Approach, High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning, Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing, Personalized Learning, High Tech and Low Tech Game-Based Learning, and Universal Design for Learning, this method provides students with a well-rounded education that emphasizes problem-solving, critical thinking, technology literacy, and creativity.

The flipped classroom approach allows students to learn at their own pace, providing teachers with more time to work with students one-on-one or in small groups, while the high-tech approach enhances learning by utilizing technology in the classroom.
