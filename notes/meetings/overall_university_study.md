What to ask:

Refine the task list and objective in the STAR Format. The STAR Format consists of defining the Space, Track, Assist, and Reach. Space = the time, location, department, and other defining variables that help give context and knowledge of the project. Track = the workload, the before and after progress done and expected, and the materials used Assist = how the worker will actually make a contribution to the project and how the worker will help the project become more autonomous once the worker departs Reach = how much exposure this project will have and how much the current contribution will make an impact and create an influence on the future of this project
