## Reach
* After the assist stage, what will it achieve?
* Current day achievement
* What's the overall achievement?
* How will it go to the next project, next track
* Are OktoPod members prepped?
* Are docs good?
* No negativities, just taking responsibility

The Reach should change the next day's STAR.
