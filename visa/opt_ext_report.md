After getting my Focus Pass<sup>TM</sup>, I had the opportunity to be in multiple-business oriented study groups, seasoned managers, and literacy programs. I have learned and applied Agile methods, taught by Curiosity Coaches during onboarding, inside these groups and meetings. I've also learned and applied GitHub Learning Lab and the 5Cs of 21st Century learning which includes cultural immersion by working with teams locally and from other countries across different time zones, creativity in developing data visualization and technical documentations, critical thinking in finding problems within the system and experiment with current methods or tools for solutions and constant communication, and collaboration with team members inside Microsoft 365 Environment and GitHub to be in the same page in a project. Through Ignite Curiosity training, it helped me build habits of passion and curiosity which helped me understand the interconnectedness of companies, of different departments of a company, and how the physical laws of the universe may apply. That I must zoom in and out to see the bigger picture and tiny details every so often, to apply thought strategy, agile mapping, and architectural mapping, as learned from Think Dojo.

With my knowledge in physics, I am a key player in getting ORBIT created with a director on a piece of paper. It includes mapping out the objectives, resources, budget, indicators, and transport necessary to help a startup business get funded through procurements. However, it was not enough to show transparency to the government or any projects. So, we added activities and logistics which now has evolved into ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup>. The concept of ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup> using the laws of physics aim to help startup businesses get launched and get them into orbit in a space of multitudinal companies or grow as a Super Nova. Also, by applying the concept of Atomic Design in physics, I was instrumental in updating their checklists for launching and orbiting.  

In the creation of these complex substances, I also use the constellation of stars concept. There are multiple big and small businesses out there from different industries. I try to figure out what kind of a star this startup client is from doing engineering requirement from client owners and then research its NAICS code and assess what kind of fuel it already has (bootstrapping). I introduced these startups to SBIR and STTR Programs to get seed funds. I communicate and collaborate with clients to understand if they want to become a massive star where it grows and might acquire other smaller businesses, or will its goal be a low mass star that just continually orbits in the galaxy. Basically, I was doing transformational consulting which I learned from Think Dojo.

In one of my projects, I have worked directly with a startup client, and I noticed they didn't have the business plan, the right NAICS code, did not adopt agile methods between employees, managers, and owners, doesn't do research and documentations and has no programming standards when doing Git Commits like proper commenting and how often to do commits. They have scattered atoms and molecules and they don't have the energy to properly combine these atoms and molecules to make into a full star. The company I'm working with is one of those stars that help combine these scattered atoms and molecules and provides fuel, so these startups gain fuel, grow bigger, shift focus and to be able to orbit on its own.

During their launch period they are fueled with new atoms of different elements and molecular combinations. These atomic elements and molecules could be in the form of picking and structuring their NAICS code, creating OKRs and KPIs, helping get licenses and bank account, perform SWOT and PESTLE Analysis, Market Analysis, create policies, activities, and logistics. And these elements when combined create molecules (technical documentations) or even complex substances or mixtures (like a business plan or business process flows, BPFs).

I was a key player in successfully building their business plan, was a role model employee to the scientists and engineers when approaching the programming tasks by using management tools, and how to do proper technical research and documentations, creativity, and be Agile. In addition, I was able to successfully map out their NAICS Codes, finish their business plan, and create their Multiple Award Schedule (MAS).

In their programming project, I worked alongside other 6 data engineers and was a key player in successfully migrating visualization charts from a legacy software to AWS QuickSight by developing custom algorithms. By being curious and experimenting on tried-and-true techniques aside from testing out custom algorithms with proper research and documentations, a learning I got from IGUANA Hive, I found out that some of the visuals need not use custom algorithms but to learn how to configure the built-in systems of AWS QuickSight to create a matching data visualization from the legacy software. 

I combined my training from the Curiosity Coaches of Think Dojo, IGUANA Hive, and Developer Dojo where I collaborate and communicate using Microsoft 365 tools with other engineers and scientists across different culture and time zones and my understanding of physics that led to this startup client getting numerous projects and is now earning almost a million USD per year. 

For the internal company, my training with Developer Dojo and the use of Atomic Design helped me to successfully edit a few startup company websites and create multiple issues and markdown-file research notes inside GitHub. Having a good website increases the chance of getting contracts and government projects.

After learning Agile methods, Microsoft 365 Tools, 5Cs of Education and CALMS Framework, I've had the opportunity to teach these methods inside Tao Learning Institute to newly hired employees and was a role model during my internship period.

After helping internally build and brand the ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup>, I went back to the Think Dojo and discussed with other managers and teams how we can have a more Agile environment. I pointed out from observation that there was a hard time for managers and product owners figuring out what these employees were doing and what tasks and priorities are set by the managers and what skills were lacking such as doing proper R & D. Then I go back to the ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup> concept and set up an issue with a STAR to drive this project forward. 

For projects/startups to stay in orbit they need STARs. This is a physics concept that we introduced to the employees. I was a key player in the creation and implementation of STAR (Space, Track, Assist, Reach) and Super Nova concept to reach milestones which help projects and startups to orbit. Super Nova is a STAR but is a massive project, has longer timelines and has bigger impact. STARs are everyday tasks that are S.M.A.R.T. and that need assistance in making tiny shifts (Focus Shifts<sup>TM</sup>) to keep or change the orbital track until it reaches a Super Nova event or to keep in orbit.

I have also been working with my team to develop hypotheses in other areas about the underlying causes or drivers of the trend, for example, choosing pedagogical approaches, researching student/employee journeys, current digital tools to use, current MEP tools, current methods, or tried-and-tested methods for employee efficiency. I helped in gathering more information, created, and discussed multiple directions, and have been doing agile logic changes in our Visio maps and Power BIs to reflect the company's goals and culture in the program.

I have also been a key player in the expansion of this company I'm working with to having multiple transport that cover different areas of the company. Some of these transports can now hold its own procurement and grant projects. I was also a key player in the acquisition of laptops from Salesforce for the STEM literacy program of the company's affiliated nonprofit.

I also helped in their construction sciences department working with the construction team to update Victorian houses in the MOV Region and turn them into Smart Homes for STEM Students like me and employees from polymer industries. I've learned how to use Revit for architectural mapping in my first year of OPT before this extension, and now applying the sciences in construction and worked alongside team members discussing MEP issues, researching solutions like applying Just-in-Time methods of buying materials or using post-its on areas that needs worked on in the house which made it easier for local contractors to spot, upgrades after researching what are the latest standard electric codes followed, and updates as to how to make them into a Smart house for a futuristic architecture, inside GitHub Issues and Microsoft 365 Environment in addition to working on-site with a few government and local contractors in the area.

I was a role-model during my internship because I made a lot of meeting notes to help communicate and collaborate with other team members with different shifts. I also actively participated during sessions where they are optimizing multiple BPFs inside Microsoft 365 Environment (Power BI).

Applying Scientific Methods, from my observation I helped in finding out pain points from employee's work efficiency which helps in the development and testing of the W4tcher App<sup>TM</sup>. These pain points may include punctuality, attendance, internet speed, lack of continuous training & development, and efficiency at work. It helps ensure optimum operation of the business because it captures the screen of the employee at random times. This is also how my employer oversees my screen activities, among other employees, while at work which affects my SMILE SCORE<sup>TM</sup>. This SMILE Score, created by Tao Learning Institute, shows my performance metric aside from the professional development sessions led by Curiosity Coaches and my GitHub profile showing my commits, comments, issues and pull requests, and project management.

With the creation of these new transports (in the research, hospitality, and digital and on-site dry labs area) and combining existing transports through Visio maps (a Microsoft 365 tool), I became a founder of the DREAM Quest and AST Program. It utilizes a tree system to visualize the growth and development of a person's professional and personal development.

With the DREAM QUEST AST Program, I must conduct statistical analysis of existing pedagogical trends that would fit, create student journey maps, and think of how to make it an edutainment program. I must identify behavior patterns on how effective these approaches are and if there are combinations that have been used by some educational bodies. This is a work in progress, but I helped in creating the milestones with issues that have proper requirement engineering in them on GitHub. 

Before choosing the right management tools, I did comparative analysis between Azure DevOps (Microsoft), MS Project, MS Planner, Projects on Github, Zenhub on GitHub, and Jira board. My analysis at that time points to Jira board because it was trending, UX/UI friendly, and is used by many startup businesses. But if there are a lot of open-source projects where we invite external contributors then we should go for GitHub.

The company did implement the learning and development of Atlassian tools to all employees and when we got a project using Atlassian tools, which includes Jira board, then everyone was equipped to handle the project.

However, for internal task management, to get a team-oriented project inside Jira, an employee needs to be onboarded into our company and use the company email for more access and I found out that it is taxing work to the IT Admin and not cost-efficient. Therefore, overtime we completely move all our task management and milestones on GitHub from Microsoft Planner and Azure DevOps. I am currently a code maintainer for various transports of this company to check Git commits, issues, and pull requests.

To summarize, I have been a key player in connecting STEM with non-profits, with polymer companies, with business startups doing transformational consulting, and actively working with locals and officials in HubZone areas like the MOV Region due to my internship as an applied physicist in this company.

### Design scientific approaches, applying tried-and-true techniques or developing custom algorithms as needed by the business problem

After helping the company build and brand the ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup>. I went back to the Think Dojo and discussed with other managers and teams how we can be more Agile. I observed that there was a hard time figuring out what these employees were working and what tasks and priorities are set by the managers. Then I go back to the ORBITAL concept. 

A project needs to have its own orbit and so executives introduced roadmapping. Roadmaps sets the timeline and has multiple milestones. I was a key player in the implementation of STAR (Space, Track, Assist, Reach) and Super Nova concept to reach milestones. Super Nova is a STAR but is a massive project, has longer timelines and has bigger impact while STARs are every day tasks and issues that needs assitance until it reach a Super Nova event.

I have worked alongside other 6 engineers and scientists, and was a key player in successfuly migrating visualization charts from a legacy software to AWS QuickSight by developing custom algorithms. By being curious and experimenting on tried-and-true techniques aside from testing out custom algorithms with proper research and documentations, I found out that some of the visuals need not use custom algorithms but to learn how to configure the built-in systems of AWS QuickSight to create a matching data visualization from the legacy software.

### Collaborate with data engineers and platform architects to implement robust decisioning solutions

I have been a key player in the expansion of this company to having multiple transports that cover different areas of the company. Some of these transports can now hold its own procurement and grant projects. I was also a key player in the acquisition of laptops from Salesforce for the STEM literacy program of the company's affiliated nonprofit.

With the creation of these new transports (in the research, hospitality, and digital and on-site dry labs area) and combining existing transports through visio maps, I became a founder of the DREAM Quest and AST Program.

### Ensure operational and business metric health by monitoring decision points

Applying Scientific Methods, from my observation I helped in finding out pain points from employee's work efficiency which helps in the development and testing of the W4tcher App<sup>TM</sup>. These pain points may include punctuality, attendance, internet speed, lack of continuous training & development, and efficiency at work. It helps ensure optimum operation of the business because it captures the screen of the employee at random times. This is also how my employer oversees my screen activities, among other employees, while at work which affects my SMILE SCORE<sup>TM</sup>. This SMILE Score, created by Tao Learning Institute, shows my performance metric aside from the professional development sessions led by the Curiosity Coaches and my GitHub account.

### Investigate adversarial trends, identify behavior patterns, and respond with Agile logic changes

With the DREAM QUEST AST Program, I have to conduct statistical analysis of existing pedagogical trends that would fit, create student journey maps, and think of how to make it an edutainment program. I have to identify behavior patterns on how effective these approaches are and if there are combinations that have been used by some educational bodies. This is a work in progress but milestones have been created with issues that has proper requirement engineering in them on GitHub. 

I have been working with my team to develop hypotheses about the underlying causes or drivers of the trend. We have been gathering more information, created and discussed multiple directions, and has been doing agile logic changes in our Visio maps (Microsoft 365 tool) to reflect the company's goals and culture in the program.

### Research on new technologies and methods across data science, data engineering, and data visualization to improve the technical capabilities of the team. Her activities train her to attain a higher level of theoretical, analytical and practical understanding of her Physics degree.&nbsp;

Before choosing the right management tools, I did comparative analysis between Azure DevOps (Microsoft), MS Project, MS Planner, Projects on Github, Zenhub on GitHub, and Jira board. My analysis at that time points to Jira board because it was trending, UX/UI friendly and is used by many businesses. But if there are a lot of open-source projects where we invite external contributors then we will go for GitHub.

The company did implement the learning and development of Atlassian tools to all employees and when we got a project using Atlassian tools, which includes Jira board, then everyone was equipped to handle the project.

However, for internal task management, to get a team-oriented project inside Jira, an employee needs to be onboarded into our company and use the company email for more access and it is a taxing work to the IT Admin. Therefore, overtime we are completely moving all our task management and milestones on GitHub from Microsoft Planner and Azure DevOps. I am currently a code maintainer for various transports of the company to check Git commits, issues, and pull requests.
