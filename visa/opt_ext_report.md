Introduction:
As an applied physicist intern, I had the opportunity to work with multiple-business oriented study groups, seasoned managers, and literacy programs. I was able to apply Agile methods, the CALMS Framework, and the 5Cs of 21st Century Learning in my work, which helped me contribute to the development of various AI products and assist startup companies in their growth and success.

Body:
During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on several projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in Agile methods and the CALMS Framework that I've learned from the Curiosity Coaches of Tao Learning Institute. One of my major contributions was helping to develop an HR app called Aini<sup>TM</sup>, which was based on these methodologies. Additionally, I was able to assist startup companies through thinking sessions and architectural planning in Think Dojo in finding opportunities by researching relevant NAICS codes and drafting procurements. I also helped these companies understand their requirements by writing out OKRs and KPIs and building their ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup> (a proprietary business process flow, BPF) for example, and then translating them into technical solutions.

I also had the opportunity to work with other engineers and scientists across different cultures and time zones through Think Dojo, where we collaborated and communicated using Microsoft 365 tools. Through this experience, I was able to successfully help a startup business by mapping out their NAICS Codes, finishing their business plan, and creating their Multiple Award Schedule (MAS).

I also received training on various tools and platforms such as GitHub Learning Lab, Advanced Notebook Applications, and Microsoft 365 tools inside Dev Dojo and IGUANA Hive. These trainings helped me to edit startup company websites and create multiple issues and markdown-file research notes inside GitHub. Additionally, I had the opportunity to teach these methods to newly hired employees during my internship period.

Conclusion:
Overall, my internship was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in various projects and assist in the growth and success of startup companies. By using Agile methods, the CALMS Framework, and the 5Cs of 21st Century Learning, I was able to contribute to the development of AI products, assist in the creation and implementation of robust decisioning solutions in multiple areas of the company, and help in the development of a W4tcher App<sup>TM</sup>. Through my training and experience, I was also able to develop strong habits of passion and curiosity, which helped me understand the interconnectedness of companies and how physical laws of the universe may apply to business.

# Segregated Answer

### Engage with business teams to find opportunities, understand requirements, and translate those requirements into technical solutions

* Accomplishments

After, getting my Focus Pass, I had the opportunity to be in multiple-business oriented study groups, seasoned managers, and literacy programs. I have learned and applied Agile methods, taught by Curiosity Coaches during onboarding, inside these groups and meetings. I've also learned and applied the 5Cs of 21st Century learning which includes cultural immersion by working with teams from other countries, creativity in developing data visualization and technical documentations, critical thinking in finding problems within the system and experiment with current methods or tools for solutions and constant communication, and collaboration with team members inside Microsoft 365 Environment to be in the same page in a project.

Through Ignite Curiosity training, it helped me build habits of passion and curiosity which helped me understand the interconnectedness of companies, of different departments of a company, and how the physical laws of the universe may apply. 

With my knowledge  in physics, I am a key player in getting ORBIT created with a Director in a piece of paper. It includes mapping out the objectives, resources, budget, indicators, and transport necessary to help a startup business get funded through procurements. Now it has evolved into ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup> with activities and logistics included. The concept of ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup> using the laws of physics aim to help startup businesses get launched and get them into orbit in a space of multitudinal companies. 

Also, by applying the concept of Atomic Design in physics, I was instrumental in creating the checklist for their launching and their orbiting. During their launch period they are fueled with atoms of different elements and molecules. These atomic elements and molecules could be in the form of their NAICS code, OKRs and KPIs, licenses, bank account, SWOT Analysis, Market Analysis, policies, activities, and logistics. And these elements when combined creates molecules (technical documentations) or even complex substances or mixtures (like a business plan or business process flows, BPFs).

In the creation of these complex substances, I also use the constellation of stars concept. There are multiple big and small businesses out there from different industries. I figure out what kind of a star is this startup client we have according to its NAICS code and what kind of fuel it already has (bootstrapping). I communicate and collaborate with clients to understand if they want to become a massive star and turns into a blackhole where it grows and then will acquire other smaller businesses or will its goal be just a low mass star that continually orbits in the galaxy.


* Successful Projects

I have worked directly with a startup client and I noticed they didn't have the business plan, the right NAICS code, did not adopt agile methods between employees, managers, and owners, doesn't do research and documentations and has no programming standards when doing Git Commits like proper commenting and how often to do commits. 

I combined my training from the Curiosity Coaches of Think Dojo, IGUANA Hive, and Dev Dojo where I collaborate and communicate using Microsoft 365 tools with other engineers and scientists cross different culture and time zones and my understanding of physics that led to this company getting numerous projects and is now earning almost a million USD per year. 

I was a key player in successfuly building their business plan, was a role model employee to the scientists and engineers when approaching the programming tasks by using management tools, and how to do proper technical research and documentations and be Agile. In addition, I was able to successfully map out their NAICS Codes, finish their business plan, and created their Multiple Award Schedule (MAS).

From my trainings with Tao Learning Institute and the use of Atomic Design I've successfully edited a few startup company websites from our clients and created multiple issues and markdown-file research notes inside GitHub.

* Overall Contribution

After learning Agile methods, Microsoft 365 Tools, 5Cs of Education and CALMS Framework, I've had the opportunity to teach these methods inside Tao Learning Institute to newly hired employees and was a role model during my internship period.

### Design scientific approaches, applying tried-and-true techniques or developing custom algorithms as needed by the business problem

After helping the company build and brand the ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup>. I went back to the Think Dojo and discussed with other managers and teams how we can be more Agile. I observed that there was a hard time figuring out what these employees were working and what tasks and priorities are set by the managers. Then I go back to the ORBITAL concept. 

A project needs to have its own orbit and so executives introduced roadmapping. Roadmaps sets the timeline and has multiple milestones. I was a key player in the implementation of STAR (Space, Track, Assist, Reach) and Super Nova concept to reach milestones. Super Nova is a STAR but is a massive project, has longer timelines and has bigger impact while STARs are every day tasks and issues that needs assitance until it reach a Super Nova event.

I have worked alongside other 6 engineers and scientists, and was a key player in successfuly migrating visualization charts from a legacy software to AWS QuickSight by developing custom algorithms. By being curious and experimenting on tried-and-true techniques aside from testing out custom algorithms with proper research and documentations, I found out that some of the visuals need not use custom algorithms but to learn how to configure the built-in systems of AWS QuickSight to create a matching data visualization from the legacy software.

### Collaborate with data engineers and platform architects to implement robust decisioning solutions

I have been a key player in the expansion of this company to having multiple transports that cover different areas of the company. Some of these transports can now hold its own procurement and grant projects. I was also a key player in the acquisition of laptops from Salesforce for the STEM literacy program of the company's affiliated nonprofit.

With the creation of these new transports (in the research, hospitality, and digital and on-site dry labs area) and combining existing transports through visio maps, I became a founder of the DREAM Quest and AST Program. It utilizes a tree system to visualize the growth and development of a person's professional and personal development.

I also helped in the construction sciences leading the construction team to update Victorian houses and make them into Smart Homes. I've learned how to use Revit for architectural mapping and work alongside with team members discussing MEP issues, upgrades and updates inside GitHub Issues and Microsoft 365 Environment.

I was a role-model during my internship because I make a lot of meeting notes to help communicate and collaborate with other team members with different shifts. I also actively participated during sessions where they are optimizing multiple BPFs inside Microsoft 365 Environment (Power BI).

### Ensure operational and business metric health by monitoring decision points

I helped in mapping out pain points from employee's work efficiency which helps in the development of a W4tcher App<sup>TM</sup>. These pain points may include punctuality, attendance, internet speed, and efficiency at work. It helps ensure optimum operation of the business because it captures the screen of the employee at random times. This is also how my employer oversees my screen activities, among other employees, while at work which affects my SMILE SCORE<sup>TM</sup>. This SMILE Score, created by Tao Learning Institute, shows my performance metric aside from the professional development sessions led by the Curiosity Coaches.

### Investigate adversarial trends, identify behavior patterns, and respond with Agile logic changes

Inside Dev Dojo, I learned how to investigate adversarial trends of BPFs using Power BI, a Microsoft 365 Tool, to identify weaknesses in an AI model inside the Microsoft 365 Environment. It uses multiple logic systems that needs modified so that when a customer interacts with an AI that is connected to a BPF, it can identify behavior patterns and respond with the appropriate logic.

### Research on new technologies and methods across data science, data engineering, and data visualization to improve the technical capabilities of the team. Her activities train her to attain a higher level of theoretical, analytical and practical understanding of her Physics degree.&nbsp;

I contributed in successfully migrating data visualizations from a legacy software to AWS QuickSight. Through proper communication and collaboration of engineers and data scientists across different culture and different timezones, we found out that some of the visuals need not use custom algorithms but, through heavy research on this new technology, to learn how to configure the built-in systems to create a matching data visualization of the legacy software instead.
