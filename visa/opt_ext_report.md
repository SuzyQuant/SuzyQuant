As an intern in the company, I have been actively engaged in various projects and initiatives that have allowed me to develop my skills as an applied scientist. I've learned the importance of OKRs and KPIs and how to work in an Agile environment. We always start to do requirement engineering in any project. We write out the objectives and key results to be able to track their outcomes. We use S.T.A.R. (Space, Track, Assist, and Reach) to map out where we are, what is the main objective and goal(s), what resources do we have, how do we assist the project to reach our objectives/goals, and what's the current reach of the project with its current indicators.

One of my key contributions has been in the research and help in writing of procurement and grant documents for multiple client companies. I was able to identify potential opportunities through US government websites, and then worked closely with my team to map out the requirements and develop a proprietary business process flow (ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup>) that met those requirements. This included drafting objectives that aligned with the procurement requirements, mapping out resources and budgets through market research and analysis, and creating documentation that was approved by our clients. Additionally, I helped ensure that our indicators were aligned with United Nations SDG Goals, NSF, and ARC, and researched on the NAICS codes for the right transport and logistics plan. I closely collaborated with the Senior Director during the first creation of ORBIT<sup>TM</sup> business process flow which now is called, ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup>.

Two among many learnings are the Toyota Production System (TPS) and SDLC methods to create efficient and effective business process flows. I have had the opportunity to work with 6 other experienced data scientists and engineers who have taught me the principles of TPS such as Just-in-Time (JIT) and Total Quality Management (TQM) and how to apply them in different areas of the business. I have also been involved in the creation of business process flows, which has allowed me to understand how different departments within the organization interact and how to optimize their processes to improve overall efficiency and productivity. This has been a valuable learning experience for me, as I have been able to understand the importance of clear communication, documentation, standardization of work processes, and the application of physical theories in business.

Additionally, I have been able to work with different teams across the organization and understand their specific requirements, which has helped me experienced drafting solutions that are tailored to their needs. This has been a challenging yet rewarding experience, as it has helped me to improve my problem-solving skills and ability to think outside the box. Another important aspect of my role has been collaborating with data engineers and platform architects to implement robust decisioning solutions. I have been involved in the development of custom algorithms for an HR management app, which has helped mitigate the problem of inconsistent clocking in and out, out of focus, setting priorities, and inefficient and insufficient output during work hours. I have also participated in sprint planning and scrum meetings with other data engineers and architects across different time zones, where we map out priorities in multiple areas of the company and build roadmaps for existing projects.

To ensure the operational and business metric health, I have experienced monitoring decision points by creating milestones on GitHub, and helped as a code maintainer to address the issues inside a few milestones. I also helped make sure that the committed Pull Requests from contributors on open-source projects are following the theme, character count, organized by priority, and hitting deadlines. In addition, I have been investigating adversarial trends, identifying behavior patterns, and responding with Agile logic changes. To do this, I have been using Power BI and spreadsheets to calculate Six Sigma (6σ), and if the result goes to 4σ or 5σ, then I help investigate to find the problem in the whole process and help draft changes for approval. Finally, I have been researching new technologies and methods across data science, data engineering, and data visualization to improve the technical capabilities of the team. This has allowed me to attain a higher level of theoretical, analytical, and practical understanding of my Physics degree.

# Segregated Answer

### Engage with business teams to find opportunities, understand requirements, and translate those requirements into technical solutions

* Accomplishments

After, getting my Focus Pass, I had the opportunity to be in multiple-business oriented study groups, seasoned managers, and literacy programs. I have learned and applied Agile methods inside these groups and meetings and use CALMS Framework when I helped develop an AI products such as Aini<sup>TM</sup>, an HR app. 

I helped find opportunities for multiple startup companies by researching relevant NAICS codes and draft procurements. I help understand requirements, by writing out OKRs and KPIs and build their ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup> (a proprietary business process flow, BPF) for example, and then translate them into technical solutions like map out what kind of apps can be created that matches the requirements of these procurements while considering the expertise of the company.

* Successful Projects

Through Think Dojo, where I collaborate and communicate using Microsoft 365 tools with other engineers and scientists cross different culture and time zones, I was able to successfully help a startup business by mapping out their NAICS Codes, finish their business plan, and created their Multiple Award Schedule (MAS).

Inside Dev Dojo, I did training with Curiosity Coaches on GitHub Learning Lab and on how to make Git contributions. In IGUANA Hive, I learned how to use Advanced Notebook Applications. From my training, I've successfully edited a few startup company websites that are our clients and created multiple issues and markdown-file research notes inside GitHub.

* Overall Contribution
After learning Agile methods, Microsoft 365 Tools, 5Cs of Education and CALMS Framework, I've had the opportunity to teach methods these inside Tao Learning Institute to newly hired employees during my internship period.

### Design scientific approaches, applying tried-and-true techniques or developing custom algorithms as needed by the business problem

By applying the 5Cs of 21st Century Learning, it helped me contribute to the initial creation of the ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup> business process flow which initially was called ORBIT<sup>TM</sup> just in a piece of paper. 

Through Ignite Curiosity training, it helped me build habits of passion and curiosity which helped me understand the interconnectedness of companies, of different departments of a company, and how the physical laws of the universe may apply. For example, applying the concept of how small stars can get sucked by massive stars, the small companies can get acquired by big companies. Or applying the concept of momentum to understand adversarial trends.

Through communication and collaboration using Microsoft 365 tools, I, along with other 6 other engineers and scientists, was able to successfuly migrate visualization charts from a legacy software to AWS QuickSight by developing custom algorithms.

### Collaborate with data engineers and platform architects to implement robust decisioning solutions

Through the strong habits I formed in the 5Cs of 21st Century Learning which include Culture, Creativity, Critical Thinking, Communication, and Collaboration, I was able to contribute in the making of a Student Journey Quest to success called Dream Quest.

Inside Think Dojo where most executives do their think-tank sessions, I helped mapped out the pain points of employees and help in the creation and implementation of robust decisioning solutions in multiple areas of the company. It includes optimizing multiple BPFs inside Microsoft 365 Environment, updating architectural maps by working together on single files, putting up GitHub Issues with proper OKRs and KPIs in their description, and creating milestones and roadmaps for startup clients using the CALMS Framework while incorporating Agile Logic.

### Ensure operational and business metric health by monitoring decision points

I helped in mapping out pain points from employee's work efficiency which helps in the development of a W4tcher App<sup>TM</sup>. These pain points may include punctuality, attendance, internet speed, and efficiency at work. It helps ensure optimum operation of the business because it captures the screen of the employee at random times. This is also how my employer oversees my screen activities, among other employees, while at work which affects my SMILE SCORE<sup>TM</sup>. This SMILE Score, powered by Tao Learning Institute, shows my performance metric aside from the professional development sessions by the Curiosity Coaches.

### Investigate adversarial trends, identify behavior patterns, and respond with Agile logic changes

Inside Dev Dojo, I learned how to investigate adversarial trends of BPFs to identify weaknesses in the model inside the Microsoft 365 Environment. It uses multiple logic systems that needs modified so that when a customer interacts with an AI that is connected to a BPF, it can identify behavior patterns and respond with the appropriate logic.

### Research on new technologies and methods across data science, data engineering, and data visualization to improve the technical capabilities of the team. Her activities train her to attain a higher level of theoretical, analytical and practical understanding of her Physics degree.&nbsp;

I contributed in successfully migrating data visualizations from a legacy software to AWS QuickSight. Through proper communication and collaboration of engineers and data scientists across different culture, we found out that some of the visuals need not use custom algorithms but, through research on this new technology, to learn how to configure the built-in systems to create a matching data visualization from the legacy software instead.
