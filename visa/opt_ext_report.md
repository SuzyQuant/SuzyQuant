Engage with business teams to find opportunities, understand requirements, and translate those requirements into technical solutions

* I research and write procurements and grants for the company. I find them from US Government websites, map out their requirements and build ORBITAL (a proprietary business process flow). Specifically, I create objectives that's aligned to othe requirements of the procurement, map out resources and budgets, making sure that indicators align with United Nations SDG Goals, NSF, and ARC, picking the right transport from their specific NAICS codes, and creating the activities, monitoring, evaluating, and logistics plan.
