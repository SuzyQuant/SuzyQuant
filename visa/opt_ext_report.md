Engage with business teams to find opportunities, understand requirements, and translate those requirements into technical solutions

* I helped in the researching and writing of multiple procurements and grants for the company. I found them from US Government websites, mapped out their requirements and built ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup> (a proprietary business process flow). 

* Specifically, I helped in drafting objectives that's aligned to othe requirements of the procurement, helped in mapping out resources and budgets through market research and analysis and then create documentations, helped in keeping track that indicators align with United Nations SDG Goals, NSF, and ARC, researched on the NAICS codes for the right transport, and helped create the activities, monitoring, evaluating, and logistics plan with the Point of Contact and other team members. I worked with a team of 6 that comprised of local and international members that is in the different timezones.

Design scientific approaches, applying tried-and-true techniques or developing custom algorithms as needed by the business problem

* I helped by doing some custom algorithms for an HR Management App and report directly to my supervisor on progress and issues by attending scrum meetings and updating of comments on specific issues. The App helps mitigate the problem of inconsistent clocking in and out, out of focus, setting priorities, and inefficient and insufficient output during work hours.

&nbsp;Collaborate with data engineers and platform architects to implement robust decisioning solutions

* I participated in sprint planning and scrum meetings with other data engineers and architects across different timezones, where they map out priorities in multiple areas of the company, build roadmaps for existing projects.

* Using Agile methods, I helped in drafting roadmaps with other team members with methods I learned in the company such as using DMADV and DMAIC that are Six Sigma tools. Then have the supervisor check, edit and approve these roadmaps before implementation.

Ensure operational and business metric health by monitoring decision points

* To monitor decision points and business health, milestones are created by executives and supervisors on GitHub. Milestones are big stages of development and can have multiple projects. Per project has its own multiple issues. I help as a code maintainer to address the issues inside a milestone. I help make sure that the commited Pull Requests from contributors on open-source projects are following the theme, character count, organized by priority, and hitting deadlines.

Investigate adversarial trends, identify behavior patterns, and respond with Agile logic changes

* I helped in doing market and industry research and documentations in multiple areas of the business to help them reach conclusions that are based on the current trends. During meetings, I do a lot of note-taking to help out team members that are not available because of different time-zones to be on the same page in a project. Then we go to our roadmap and kanban boards for issue creation, getting it assigned, and backlog maintenance.
