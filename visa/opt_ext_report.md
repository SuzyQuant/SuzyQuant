# Single Paragraph Answer 1

As an intern in this company, I have been actively engaged in various projects and initiatives that have allowed me to develop my skills as an applied scientist. 

One of my key contributions has been in the research and help in writing of procurement and grant documents for multiple client companies. I was able to identify potential opportunities through US government websites, and then worked closely with my team to map out the requirements and develop a proprietary business process flow (ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup>) that met those requirements. This included drafting objectives that aligned with the procurement requirements, mapping out resources and budgets through market research and analysis, and creating documentation that was approved by our clients. Additionally, I helped ensure that our indicators were aligned with United Nations SDG Goals, NSF, and ARC, and researched on the NAICS codes for the right transport and logistics plan. I closely collaborated with the Senior Director during the first creation of ORBIT<sup>TM</sup> business process flow which now is called, ORBITAL<sup>TM</sup>.

Two among many learnings are the Toyota Production System (TPS) and SDLC methods to create efficient and effective business process flows. I have had the opportunity to work with 6 other experienced data scientists and engineers who have taught me the principles of TPS such as Just-in-Time (JIT) and Total Quality Management (TQM) and how to apply them in different areas of the business.

I have also been involved in the creation of business process flows, which has allowed me to understand how different departments within the organization interact and how to optimize their processes to improve overall efficiency and productivity. This has been a valuable learning experience for me, as I have been able to understand the importance of clear communication, documentation, standardization of work processes, and the application of physical theories in business.

Additionally, I have been able to work with different teams across the organization and understand their specific requirements, which has helped me experienced drafting solutions that are tailored to their needs. This has been a challenging yet rewarding experience, as it has helped me to improve my problem-solving skills and ability to think outside the box.

Another important aspect of my role has been collaborating with data engineers and platform architects to implement robust decisioning solutions. I have been involved in the development of custom algorithms for an HR management app, which has helped mitigate the problem of inconsistent clocking in and out, out of focus, setting priorities, and inefficient and insufficient output during work hours. I have also participated in sprint planning and scrum meetings with other data engineers and architects across different time zones, where we map out priorities in multiple areas of the company and build roadmaps for existing projects.

To ensure the operational and business metric health, I have experienced monitoring decision points by creating milestones on GitHub, and helped as a code maintainer to address the issues inside a few milestones. I also helped make sure that the committed Pull Requests from contributors on open-source projects are following the theme, character count, organized by priority, and hitting deadlines.

In addition, I have been investigating adversarial trends, identifying behavior patterns, and responding with Agile logic changes. To do this, I have been using Power BI and spreadsheets to calculate Six Sigma (6σ), and if the result goes to 4σ or 5σ, then I help investigate to find the problem in the whole process and help draft changes for approval.

Finally, I have been researching new technologies and methods across data science, data engineering, and data visualization to improve the technical capabilities of the team. This has allowed me to attain a higher level of theoretical, analytical, and practical understanding of my Physics degree.

# Segregated Answer

Engage with business teams to find opportunities, understand requirements, and translate those requirements into technical solutions

* I helped in the research and writing of procurements and grants for multiple client companies. I found them from US Government websites, mapped out their requirements and helped build their ORBITALTM (a proprietary business process flow).
* Specifically, I helped in drafting objectives that's aligned to the requirements of the procurement, helped in mapping out resources and budgets through market research and analysis and then create documentations and have them approved, helped in keeping track that the indicators are aligned with United Nations SDG Goals, NSF, and ARC, researched on the NAICS codes for the right transport, and helped create the activities, monitoring, evaluating, and logistics plan with the Point of Contact and other team members. I worked with a team of 6 engineers and data scientists that comprised of local and international members of different cultures and in different time zones.
* I also learned multiple business process flows and how they are created using Power BI.

Design scientific approaches, applying tried-and-true techniques or developing custom algorithms as needed by the business problem

* I helped by doing some custom algorithms for an HR Management App and report directly to my supervisor on progress and issues by attending scrum meetings and updating comments on specific issues on GitHub. The App helps mitigate the problem of inconsistent clocking in and out, out of focus, setting priorities, and inefficient and insufficient output during work hours.

&nbsp;Collaborate with data engineers and platform architects to implement robust decisioning solutions

* I participated in sprint planning and scrum meetings with other data engineers and architects across different time zones, where they map out priorities in multiple areas of the company and where they built roadmaps for existing projects.
* Using Agile methods, I helped in drafting roadmaps with other team members with methods I learned in the company such as using DMADV and DMAIC that are Six Sigma tools. Then have the supervisor check, edit, and approve these roadmaps before implementation.

Ensure operational and business metric health by monitoring decision points

* To monitor decision points and business health, milestones are created by executives and supervisors on GitHub. Milestones are big stages of development and can have multiple projects. Per project has its own multiple issues. I help as a code maintainer to address the issues inside a few milestones. I help make sure that the committed Pull Requests from contributors on open-source projects are following the theme, character count, organized by priority, and hitting deadlines.

Investigate adversarial trends, identify behavior patterns, and respond with Agile logic changes

* I helped in checking trends and make reports of employees work efficiency through Power BI and Spreadsheets that calculates Six Sigma. If the result goes to 4- or 5-sigma, then I help investigate to find the problem in the whole process and help draft changes and if they get approved then the executives may implement these changes to obtain efficiency. During meetings, I did a lot of notetakings to help team members that are not available because of different time-zones to be on the same page in a project. We update our Issues through commits too. Then we go to our roadmap and Kanban boards for issue creation, getting it assigned, and backlog maintenance once we have an overlapping time. Basically, this is how we communicate and collaborate with each other internationally which is through our internal Kanban Boards, MS Teams Meetings, and GitHub Commits on open-source projects.

Research on new technologies and methods across data science, data engineering, and data visualization to improve the technical capabilities of the team. Her activities train her to attain a higher level of theoretical, analytical and practical understanding of her Physics degree.&nbsp;

* I helped in doing market and industry research and documentation in multiple areas of the business to help them reach conclusions that are based on the current trends. I did Python, DAX, SQL, and C# programming in doing analytical calculations in finding trends and in helping build a few AI products. I used Outsystems, Visio Maps, AWS Quick Sight, Flourish Studio, and Office 365 among others for data visualization.
