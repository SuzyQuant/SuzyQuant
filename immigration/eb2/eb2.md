## Overview for [EB-2 Visa NIW](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2)

The EB-2 visa NIW (National Interest Waiver) is a classification of employment-based immigration visa that allows a foreign national to skip the labor certification process and receive an employment-based green card. This visa is reserved for individuals who possess advanced degrees or exceptional abilities, and who can demonstrate that their work is in the national interest of the United States. The EB-2 NIW can be obtained without a job offer or a U.S. employer sponsor. The applicant must demonstrate that their work is in the national interest of the United States, and that the visa would benefit the U.S. economy, culture, or educational system.

Use the following checklist to ensure that you have all the necessary documents and information to apply for an EB-2 NIW. This should take over 100 hours to complete and we do recommend working with a consultant. Though, you are allowed to "self-petition" and submit the documents on your own.  

The submission for an EB-2 NIW Visa typically includes a petition letter, supporting evidence, and any available supplemental materials. The total number of pages depends on the individual case, but generally the submission would range from 20 to 50 pages. pages total for your submission.

areas such as business, entrepreneurialism, science, technology, culture, health, or education. In

We recognize that forecasting feasibility or future success may present challenges to petitioners and USCIS officers, and that many innovations and entrepreneurial endeavors may ultimately fail, in whole or in part, despite an intelligent plan and competent execution. We do not, therefore, require petitioners to demonstrate that their endeavors are more likely than not to ultimately succeed. But notwithstanding this inherent uncertainty, in order to merit a national interest waiver, petitioners must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they are well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.</td>

            <td rowspan=10>Prong III: National Interest Waiver</td>
            <td colspan=3>This prong allows immigrants to bypass the labor certification process and receive their visa without demonstrating that there are no qualified U.S. workers available. Applicants must demonstrate that their presence in the U.S. is in the national interest and that they are able to make an exceptional contribution to their field.
<br>
The third prong requires the petitioner to demonstrate that, on balance, it would be beneficial to the 
United States to waive the requirements of a job offer and thus of a labor certification. In 
performing this analysis, USCIS may evaluate factors such as: whether, in light of the nature of the 
foreign national's qualifications or the proposed endeavor, it would be impractical either for the 
foreign national to secure a job offer or for the petitioner to obtain a labor certification; whether, even assuming that other qualified U.S. workers are available, the United States would still benefit 
from the foreign national's contributions; and whether the national interest in the foreign national's 
contributions is sufficiently urgent to warrant forgoing the labor certification process. In each case, 
the factor(s) considered must, taken together, indicate that on balance, it would be beneficial to the 
United States to waive the requirements of a job offer and thus of a labor certification.

Requires the petitioner to: **demonstrate that the national interest would be adversely affected if a labor certification were required**
- If a labor certification were required for an EB-2 Petitioner, it would cause a significant delay in the process, which could have a detrimental effect on the national interest. Labor certification can be a lengthy process, often taking months or even years to complete. This delay could impede the progress of research or other important projects that the EB-2 Petitioner was hoping to accomplish in the United States. The delay could also cause detrimental economic effects, such as a decrease in foreign investment or a decrease in the number of jobs created in the United States. Additionally, the delay could cause a decrease in the number of skilled workers entering the United States, which could have a negative impact on the American economy. The labor certification process could also cause a decrease in the number of foreign-born entrepreneurs entering the United States, which could lead to a decrease in innovation and economic growth. All of these effects could have a significant negative impact on the national interest.
**demonstrate that the individual presents a national benefit so great as to outweigh the national interest inherent in the labor certification process**
- This could include a demonstrated ability to create jobs, a significant contribution to the advancement of a particular industry or sector, a major contribution to innovation and technological advancement, or a demonstrated ability to increase the country‚Äôs economic competitiveness. The individual must also have a history of success in their field and a track record of producing results that demonstrate the potential to benefit the country. Additionally, the individual should be able to demonstrate a commitment to the country and its values.
**establish that the individual will serve the national importance to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications**
- To establish that an individual will serve national importance to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications, the individual must demonstrate that their skills and abilities are significantly beyond the abilities of an available U.S. worker with the same qualifications. This may include evidence of specialized knowledge or experience, awards, research accomplishments, or other achievements that demonstrate the individual's unique contributions to the field. The individual should also provide evidence that their services are in the national interest, such as evidence of the potential economic, scientific, or cultural benefits of their services.
**clearly establish that the alien‚Äôs past record justifies projections of future benefit to the national importance**
- In order to clearly establish that an alien‚Äôs past record justifies projections of future benefit to the national importance, there must be evidence that the alien has demonstrated a commitment to their field of work and a tangible record of accomplishments, such as awards, publications, or other recognitions. Additionally, the alien must have a history of promoting the public good through their actions, such as volunteer work, community involvement, or philanthropy. Finally, the alien must have a history of advocating for national interests and policies, either through petitioning government officials or through their professional or personal activities.
